        <p class="bio">
          My name is Jarren Calizo, and I'm a first-year Computer Science
          graduate student at Portland State. I am passionate about
          cybersecurity, web development, and building creative tech projects
          that balance form, function, and accessibility. This course is a way
          for me to sharpen my front-end skills and revisit the side of code
          that first got me excited about tech in high school.

          The Engineering Building is a concrete and glass, five-story building
          located on SW 4th Avenue just south of the Fourth Avenue Building and
          City of Portland Development Tower. The basement of the Engineering
          Building pre-dates its construction and is actually part of the Fourth
          Avenue Building. Designed by the architectural firm, Zimmer Gunsul
          Frasca, the Engineering Building was completed in early 2006.
